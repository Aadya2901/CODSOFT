This is my Git repository to showcase my tasks completed during my internship at CODSOFT.

My first task was to create a Calculator Program. This C++ calculator program performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to enter an operator (either +, -, *, or /) and two numerical operands. The program uses a switch-case structure to determine which operation to perform based on the entered operator. If the user chooses division and attempts to divide by zero, the program gracefully handles this by displaying an appropriate error message. This simple calculator is designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of user input, control structures, and basic arithmetic operations in C++.

Secondly, I was required to create a Number Guessing Game Program. The number guessing game in C++ is an interactive program where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game begins by the program generating a random number, typically within a range like 1 to 100. The player then inputs their guesses, and the program provides feedback on whether each guess is too high, too low, or correct. This feedback helps guide the player towards the correct number. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or decides to exit. This simple game helps players enhance their logical thinking and problem-solving skills while providing an enjoyable coding experience.

Thirdly, I created a simple Tic Tac Toe Program. The objective of this program is to create a simple, console-based Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other on the same computer. The Tic Tac Toe program utilizes several key programming concepts and components such as data structures, functions, control flow, user input and output and game logic.
